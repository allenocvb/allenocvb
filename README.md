I'm **Allen**, a software engineer and a soon-to-be computer science graduate from Penn State.

- 🛠️ I enjoy learning how to design scalable systems and building apps that make people smile.
- 📱 Mostly interested in **full-stack iOS & Android development**, but I also dabble in **Distributed Systems** and **Artificial Intelligence (and more)**.
- ✍️ My favorite code editor right now is **Zed** (fast, clean, and keeps my brain from being overwhelmed).
- 🏈 Philly sports fan through and through — **Eagles**, **Phillies**, and unfortunately the **76ers** (they break my heart the most).
- 🎮 Some of my favorite video games: HFF, Roblox, Rainbow Six Siege, Sunset Overdrive (first game my friend gifted to me to play on Xbox :) ), Stardew Valley, Sea of Thieves.
- 🌌 Currently interested in the *history of astronomy* and how our understanding of the universe evolved.

    if (working) {
        money++;
    } else {
        money--;
    }
}

**Dream**
```
while (alive) {
    if (working) {
        money++;
    }

    if (!working) {
        money++;
    }
}
```
